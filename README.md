# Abigail EBPR SBR Community Analysis
 
This repository contains scripts, code, and data for analyzing microbial community data (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, ppk1 qPCR, and genome-resolved metagenomics) of the Abigail sequencing batch bioreactor simulating EBPR in the McMahon Lab in Spring of 2021. 

This reactor was named after [Dr. Abigail Salyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_A._Salyers), a microbiologist who studied antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and the human microbiome. 

Raw data and results files including 16S OTU and taxonomy tables, qPCR results, sample extraction sheets, and chemical metadata are in the [Abigail Bioreactor Figshare Project Repository](https://figshare.com/projects/Abigail_EBPR_Bioreactor/149212)

Raw sequencing files such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing fastq files, shotgun metagenomic sequencing fastq files, and non-redundant metagenome-assembled genome FASTAs are available on NCBI at the [Bioproject Accession PRJNAPRJNA881609](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA881609).
