# Abigail EBPR SBR Community Analysis
 
This repository contains scripts, code, and data for analyzing microbial community data (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, ppk1 qPCR, and metagenomic sequencing) of the Abigail sequencing batch bioreactor simulating EBPR in the McMahon Lab in Spring of 2021. 

This reactor was named after [Dr. Abigail Salyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_A._Salyers), a microbiologist who studied antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and the human microbiome.
